# Canal-Street-Market-website
A frontend project I did found on [Frontendpractice.com](https://www.frontendpractice.com/) to practice. Based off the [Backstage](https://canalstreet.market/) website listed.

## Finished product
Here you can find the finish [project](https://taupe-kleicha-d94a15.netlify.app/). The HTML is simple, using semantic HTML5 markup and the BEM naming convetion to make it clean and readable. The Header is fixed to the screen, whilst each section has an auto scroll which was implemented with Typescript.
